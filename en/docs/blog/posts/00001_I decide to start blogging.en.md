# I've Decided to Start a Blog
A lot has happened over the past six months that has made me reflect deeply. Posting bits of my thoughts on social media has sparked a lot of discussion in the comments. Through this process, I've come to realize several key benefits of writing:

Writing helps clarify my thought process, allowing me to examine overlooked aspects and mistakes in my reasoning, leading to more rigorous and comprehensive thinking. It enables me to share my views efficiently, enhancing the quality of discussion and helping identify core differences of opinion for further exploration. Building on the second point, to make my arguments more convincing, I need to continually improve my communication skills—especially by organizing issues logically and focusing on key points. A few days ago, I came across a quote by Paul Graham (who, as it turns out, was quoting Leslie Lamport):

> "If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking."
> 
> — Leslie Lamp

> -- [Paul Graham on X](https://x.com/paulg/status/1528288106734141440?lang=en)

This resonated with me deeply. So, I've decided to start a blog, even if no one reads it (though I’m quite optimistic that won’t be the case). On the day I leave this world, if I can leave anything of value behind, I hope these writings will be among the most enduring and meaningful things I contribute.

Although I’m a software engineer, my goal is to explore universal insights through this blog, touching on topics like career, society, science, and beyond—not just confined to the narrow field of computer science.

So welcome, my friend!
